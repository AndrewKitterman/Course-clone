Before getting started, you need to install some Julia packages. For this, click on the tab Console at the top. Inside the console type:

    juser@juliabox:~$ cd numerical_linear_algebra
    juser@juliabox:~/numerical_linear_algebra$ julia install_all_packages.jl 

You may use TAB for name completion. This will install all the required Julia packages. It will take a few minutes to install the packages. These packages are required to be able to create plots.
