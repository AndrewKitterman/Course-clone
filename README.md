# Julia code for the book Numerical Linear Algebra

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EricDarve/numerical_linear_algebra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EricDarve/numerical_linear_algebra)

To use this code, please go to [Julia box](https://www.juliabox.com).

Create an account and log in.

Click on the tab at the top called "Sync".

In the form under "Git Repositories", enter the address

Enter

    master

and

    numerical_linear_algebra

under Branch and "JuliaBox Folder". Then click the + button. This will create a new git repository in your account with all the files.

If you click on the tab Jupyter at the top, you should see the new directory "numerical_linear_algebra". If you want to check that everything works, you can click on

    numerical_linear_algebra

then on 

    Demo.ipynb

inside the directory.
    
Wait for the kernel to be ready (check the top right corner of the window), then click on Cell -> Run All to update the plot. Read the notebook. You should see a plot at the end.
