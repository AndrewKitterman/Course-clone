# Julia code for the book Numerical Linear Algebra

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EricDarve/numerical_linear_algebra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EricDarve/numerical_linear_algebra)

To use this code, please go to [Julia box](https://www.juliabox.com).

Create an account and log in.

The first step is to download the GitHub repository that contains the code. For this you need to copy your JuliaBox SSH keys to GitHub.

Step 1: on JuliaBox, click on `Settings` (under your login name in the top right). Copy your SSH key. It starts with `ssh-rsa`.

Step 2: go to your GitHub account, click on `Settings` (also under your name in the top right). Then select the tab `SSH and GPG keys`. Click on `New SSH key` and paste your JuliaBox key.

The next step is to download the repository to JuliaBox. 

Step 3: in JuliaBox, click on the button called `Git` (it's under `Dashboard`).

In the form, enter the address

    https://github.com/EricDarve/numerical_linear_algebra.git

in `Git Clone URL`. Then click the `+` button. This will create a new git repository in your account with all the files.

Step 4: from the dashboard, click on `Launch`. This will start a new Jupyter session. You should now see the new directory "numerical_linear_algebra". If you want to check that everything works, you can click on

    numerical_linear_algebra

then on 

    Demo.ipynb

inside the directory.
    
Wait for the kernel to be ready (check the top right corner of the window), then click on Cell -> Run All to update the plot. Read the notebook. You should see a plot at the end.

You are now ready to go!
